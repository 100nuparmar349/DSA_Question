/*
 Problem statement
You have given a sorted array 'A' of 'N' integers.
Now, you are given 'Q' queries, and each query consists of a single integer 'X'.
 Your task is to check whether 'X' is present in array 'A' or not for each query. 
 If 'X' exists in array 'A', you need to print 1 else print 0.
Note :

The given array is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Approach 
Apply Binary search if it's present in the array so return 1 otherwise return 0.
