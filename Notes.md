# DSA_Question Notes

# Introduction of the Linked List.

- // Linked List is linear data structure 
// It's a dynamic data structure  
// we connect each data with a chain .
// I'ts chain is link to attached each data 
// It's store the data in a heap memory
// NUll is reperesent null.
// In java we store reference variable . Reference variable point to object. and object is node 
// First value to store in Node class  is data  
// Next variable ka type node hi hoga .kyu ki node point karta hai object ko 

// Every single data two parts
// 1. which type of data can be store
// 2. next is reference . it's a pointer to point the next node 
- In doubly linked list we pointing to the back but in single linked list cann't do.
- in the linked list next is pointing to the next node.


# Stack
- TOP :- This structure is use for access the topest element.
- pop :- This structure is use for empty the stack.
- push :- push is used to insert the data into the stack


static_cast<long long>(mid*mid);

map<Node*,int>mpp;


# Tortise and horse 
Node* slow=head;
Node* fast=head;
slow increase by one .
fast increase by two.

# Put data in hashmap.
mpp.put({temp,1});
